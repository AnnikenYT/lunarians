		Our society was established by a large group of our ancestors from the
		planet Kelper-10b situated between the Cygnus and Lyra constellation in
		the milky way galaxy. The planet was perfect, life thrived upon it, and
		many gave it the nickname the garden of Eden, Kelper 10b stood as a sign
		of peace and prosperity among war and struggle. However, throughout
		years of constant combat the planet became scorched and gnarled, covered
		in lakes of lava from years of constant bombing of Kelper 10bâ€™s once
		beautiful surface.
