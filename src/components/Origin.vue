		Many Eons later the Lavanites were in battle with their strongest
		opponent yet the Calactions, who were slowly taking control of the
		cygnus constellation, and in an attempt to wipe out the Lavanites main
		base of operation on Kelper 10b the Calactions destabilized Kelper 10,
		the star that the all the planets in the Kelper system orbited, the
		lavanites knew that if this were to be left it would destroy the whole
		system killing trillions of innocent life forms, so they had no choice
		but to sacrifice their home planet Kelper 10b In order to stabilize the
		black star that Kelper 10 had been reduced to, they set off an ion beam
		that allowed them to use Kelper 10c as a gravitational slingshot
		directly into Kelper 10 the now black star, the Calactions were then
		left to fight using what little they had left in space of their army and
		were promptly defeated. During the space skirmish the lavanites took
		heavy damage and couldnâ€™t change course or turn off thrusters, they were
		doomed to a destiny of floating amongst the cosmos until death fell upon
		their doorstep, all hope appeared to have vanished, but by sheer luck
		the lavanites main battle ships collided with the moon and by using
		earth as a gravitational slingshot they landed. Upon their landing the
		lavanites set up temporary towns to house all those on the ships. They
		built a memorial to those that had fallen in combat against the
		Calactions, whether that be through heroism in battle or due to floating
		off into the cosmos to live or die. However, there was an even bigger
		problem. The moon was currently inhabited by the leviathan worm a
		hellish thing that was some 300 metres long and covered from head to
		tail in thick grey keratin armour, it head twisted and turned and its
		thousands of emerald and amethyst hued eyes glistened in the lunar
		sunset, its skin was mottled and scared, a sign of it besting previous
		lunar settlers in battle, and its jaw hung open its sinew relaxing and
		contracting as it snapped its gargantuan jaw together brandishing rows
		of yellow and white needle like teeth coated in unctuous slime and
		saliva.
